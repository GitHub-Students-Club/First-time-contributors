# Open-Source-Contribution
Creating a fork is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit Pull Requests to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

To fork a repository, in the top-right corner of the page, click <b>Fork</b>.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit a <a href="https://github.com/GitHub-Students-Club/First-time-contributors/pulls">Pull Request</a> as practice.
