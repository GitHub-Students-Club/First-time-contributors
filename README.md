# First-Contribution
Creating a fork is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy.

To fork a repository, in the top-right corner of the page, click <b>Fork</b>.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit a <a href="https://github.com/GitHub-Students-Club/First-time-contributors/pulls">Pull Request</a> as practice.
